# Life Expectancy (WHO)

Milestone project - Interactive Frontend Development

In this project i used data from The World Health Board which was open sourced from the website Kaggle. The link to the data is here. The data which is collected from the year 2015 measures different factors to quantify the different levels of the standard of living. Ive categorised it so that i can illustrate to the audience by visualisation a comparision of 2 representations. Developed Countries and Developing Countries.
